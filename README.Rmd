The goal of `droughtR` is to enable meteorological drought monitoring by generating non-stationary drought indices under various distributional assumptions (Normal, Gamma, Zero Inflated Gamma and Weibull). It computes the stationary (SPI) and the non-stationary (NSPI) Standardized Precipitation Indices using General Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). 

<!-- Since drought indices are mainly used in forecasting applications, `droughtR` computes potential biases introduced during the model building process due to incorrect computation of the index. -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = "README_figs/README-"
)
```

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install the development version on Github
devtools::install_github("mammask/droughtR")
```

## Usage

### Generate SPI and NSPI

```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
# Load droughtR library
library(droughtR)

# Generate synthetic monthly rainfall data using the Gamma distribution
rain = dummyrainfall(startYear = 1950, endYear = 2010)

# Compute the non-stationary standardized precipitation index (NSPI) for scale 12 using GAMLSS
drought = computenspi(x = rain, stationaryspi = FALSE, spiScale = 12, dist = 'gamma')

# Plot NSPI
plot(drought)
```

### Reduced-Bias forecasting framework

#### Data Split

You can simply split the data into train, validation and test using `oossplit`:

```{r, out.width="400px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./README_figs/data split.png")
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Split the rainfall series into training validation and test set:
rain = oossplit(x = rain, trainratio = 0.6, validationratio = 0.2, testratio = 0.2)
print(rain)
```

#### Bias measurement

When the Standardized Precipitation Index is calculated as part of a forecasting task it introduces biases in the training data. This is mainly observed when the index is computed using the entire data, prior to model validation, and this violates some of the fundamental principles of time series forecasting theory [@mammas2021characterization].

In this section, the amount of bias introduced to the training data is quantified by measuring the number of miss-classifications when two computational approaches are followed: 1) SPI is computed using the training data only; this is called a "Bias Corrected" computation and 2) SPI is computed using the entire data; this is called a "Bias Induced" computation. 

Bias is measured by computing the number of miss-classifications in the training data due to the incorrect computation of the index.

```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
# Generate synthetic monthly rainfall data using the Gamma distribution
rain = dummyrainfall(startYear = 1950, endYear = 2010)

# Compute bias
bias = measurebias(x = rain, trainratio = 0.6, validationratio = 0.2, testratio = 0.2, stationaryspi = TRUE, spiscale = 12, dist = 'normal')
bias
```

<!-- #### Bias Corrected auto.arima -->

<!-- In this section, we perform out-of-sample validation using a bias corrected auto.arima to forecast the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). An additional parameter is introduced to forecast::auto.arima and requires fitting a S-ARIMA model: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5} -->
<!-- # out-of-sample validation using a bias corrected auto.arima -->
<!-- model = bcautoarima(x = rain, -->
<!--                     trainratio = 0.8, -->
<!--                     validationratio = 0.0, -->
<!--                     testratio = 0.2, -->
<!--                     stationaryspi = TRUE, -->
<!--                     spiscale = 12, -->
<!--                     seasonal = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The model returns a set of diagnostics and analytical outcomes, including the model description, diagnostics plots and actual vs. predicted forecasts: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- # Return the model description -->
<!-- model[['Diagnostics']][['Model Description']] -->

<!-- # Return R2 score in the test set -->
<!-- model[['Diagnostics']][['R2 Score Test']] -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Actual vs. predicted SPI in the test set: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, echo = TRUE} -->
